    <!-- 
    The TikTok Comment Tool is designed to assist users in managing comments 
    effectively on TikTok. This app utilizes MadHub's capabilities to provide 
    seamless social media management and content scheduling.
    -->

    <!-- Define permissions required for the app to function properly -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <!-- 
    In this scenario, INTERNET permission is critical as the app needs 
    network access to interact with TikTok's API for comment management.
    -->

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <!-- 
    This permission allows the app to check the current network status, 
    ensuring that operations occur only when a connection is available.
    Useful in scenarios where the user is scheduling comments.
    -->

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <!-- 
    This permission enables the app to save user data and logs to 
    external storage. In practical use cases, it is essential for users 
    to store configuration files or logs for reference.

### Explanation of the Manifest File

- **Permissions**: Each permission is strategically selected to support the functionalities of the TikTok comment management tool. For instance, the `INTERNET` permission is essential for network interactions, such as posting comments or fetching data, while `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` enables the storage of user settings or logs.

- **Application Components**:
  - **MainActivity**: This serves as the main interface where users can set up their comment management parameters. When a user opens the app, they will initially interact with this component for configuration.
  - **AutomationService**: This component is responsible for performing background operations, like automating the posting of scheduled comments, ensuring that users can engage with their audience even when they are not actively using the app.

Overall, this AndroidManifest.xml is structured to create a robust and compliant application that adheres to best practices while emphasizing the core functionalities of the TikTok comment tool through a scenario-based approach.
